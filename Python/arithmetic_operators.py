# -------------------------------------- Task --------------------------------------:
# The provided code stub reads two integers from STDIN, 'a' and 'b'. Add code to print three lines where:
# - The first line contains the sum of the two numbers.
# - The second line contains the difference of the two numbers (first - second).
# - The third line contains the product of the two numbers.
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


# taking input and changing it to "int" type
a = int(input())
b = int(input())

print(a + b)
print(a - b)
print(a * b)
